### Building from Source

    make deps

    dist/confluent_$(go env GOOS)_$(go env GOARCH)/confluent -h

#### Cross Compile for Other Platforms

Cross compilation from a Darwin/amd64 machine to Darwin/arm64, Linux/amd64 and Windows/amd64 platforms is supported.
To build for Darwin/arm64, run the following:

    GOARCH=arm64 make cross-build

To build for Linux (glibc or musl), install cross compiler `musl-cross` with homebrew:

    brew install FiloSottile/musl-cross/musl-cross
    GOOS=linux make cross-build

To build for Windows/amd64, install `mingw-w64` compilers with homebrew:

    brew install mingw-w64
    GOOS=windows make cross-build

Cross compilation from an M1 Macbook (Darwin/arm64) to other platforms is also supported.

#### Troubleshooting

Please update your system to MacOS 11.0 or later if you are building on Darwin/arm64.
