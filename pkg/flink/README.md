### flink

#### Run prototype with static mock

#### Local properties

We'll add a couple of local properties to configure the client which aren't flink related and will only exist in the client. We'll for now document these here until we have a official documentation for the client.

| Property | Description | Default |
| client.results-timeout | the total amount of time in seconds to wait before timing out the request waiting for results to be ready | 600 (10 min) |
