 * ## Confluent Metadata API - Swagger UI --- This tool (SwaggerUI) and the Open API spec file are provided _for development / test purposes only_:  - **Do _not_ enable in Production.** - **This tool only works with HTTP.**  ### Authenticating Authentication is performed by HTTP Basic Auth or by presenting a bearer token. In this UI, click **Authorize** to enter credentials.  To get a bearer token, first call the authenticate endpoint with basic auth, and then extract the auth_token part of the request, and pass that as the bearer token.  ### Access Restrictions - Who can call what?  Some endpoints can be called by any authenticated user, while others can only be called by \"admins\". Additionally, many of the endpoints in the API involve two users: the user who is calling the endpoint (the \"calling\" principal) and the user that the API call is about (the \"target\" principal).  Example: User \"alice\", who has the UserAdmin role, and is identifed by her basic auth credentials or a bearer token, calls the CRUD endpoint to modify role bindings about user \"bob\".  To document what access restrictions each endpoint has, use the following legend, which lists access in order from least restrictive to most restrictive:  *  **LDAP**: Any authenticated LDAP user *  **Admins+User**: Admins or the user requesting information about themself *  **Admins+ResourceOwners**: Admins or users with ResourceOwner role *  **Admins+AclUsers**: Admins or the user having the required ACL permissions *  **Admins**: Admins only, which can be UserAdmin, SystemAdmin, broker super.user, or SecurityAdmin as \"Read\"  ### Overview of Responses  **Valid**  * 200 - Successful call with a return body. * 204 - Sucessuful call with **no** return body.  **Errors**  * 400 - Invalid request.  JSON parsing error, or otherwise incorrect request. * 401 - Not Authenticated.  You need to pass valid basic auth credentials or a user bearer token. * 403 - Not Authorized.  Valid request, but you aren't authorized to perform the requested action. * 404 - Invalid URL.  If you get this error from the authenticate endpoint, it means bearer token authentication needs to be enabled in the configuration.     * ``confluent.metadata.server.authentication.method=BEARER`` * 405 - Method Not Allowed.  Using the wrong HTTP method on a valid endpoint (for example, GET instead of POST). * 409 - Conflict.  Adding a new resource or updating an existing resource which would result in a conflict with existing state.     * can be thrown by Audit Logs and Cluster Registry APIs * 415 - Invalid Content Type.  Usually, not sending \"application/json\" as request body header. * 500 - Server Error.  ### Special Resource Types  Cluster and KsqlCluster are special ResourceTypes because they grant resource-scoped roles like ResourceOwner and DeveloperManage limited access to cluster-level operations (for example, Describe Configs on Kafka clusters). These special resource types only accept LITERAL patterns with the values \"kafka-cluster\" and \"kql-cluster\", respectively.  ### Private RBAC UI Endpoints  These endpoints were developed specifically to power the Confluent Control Center UI. As such, they only focus on those use cases and have only been tested in the context of Confluent Control Center. These endpoints have not been tested, nor has their usability been evaluated with respect to manual API calls.

// AuditLogConfigRouteCategories Once the most specific matching route for an event is selected based on the event's associated resource (CRN), it is then matched within that route to exactly one event category rule, based on the category of event, and finally matched within the category rule to a logging destination based on whether the event was \"allowed\" or \"denied\".  Event categories include ``authorize``, ``management``, ``authentication``, ``interbroker``, ``produce``, ``consume``, ``heartbeat``, and ``describe``.  The ``authorize`` category of events are those where the metadata service was asked to check whether the principal was authorized via RBAC to perform an operation on a resource.  The ``management`` category of events are those involving Kafka APIs that alter cluster or topic configuration settings, create, delete or modify topics or delegation tokens, initiate shutdown, etc.  The ``produce``, ``consume``, ``interbroker``, ``heartbeat``, and ``describe`` categories may include a potentially high volume of events. For example, every \"fetch\" request received by a Kafka broker from a Kafka consumer could result in one or more auditable events in the ``consume`` category. Consider the possible write load on your audit log destination cluster before enabling audit logging for these categories.  If the matched rule's logging destination is the empty string, the event is discarded.  If the logging destination is ``null``, matched events in the ``authentication``, ``authorize`` and ``management`` categories will be routed to the corresponding entry in ``default_topics``; but matched events in any other category will be discarded.  Note: the ``other`` category is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
