Error: no API key selected for resource "lkc-abc123"

Suggestions:
    Select an API key for resource "lkc-abc123" with `ccloud api-key use <API_KEY> --resource lkc-abc123`.
    To do so, you must have either already created or stored an API key for the resource.
    To create an API key, use `ccloud api-key create --resource lkc-abc123`.
    To store an existing API key, use `ccloud api-key store --resource lkc-abc123`.
