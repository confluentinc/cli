DEPRECATED: Delete a ksqlDB app. In the next major release, the `confluent ksql app` commands will be removed. Use the equivalent `confluent ksql cluster` commands instead.

Usage:
  confluent ksql app delete <id> [flags]

Flags:
      --context string       CLI context name.
      --environment string   Environment ID.

Global Flags:
  -h, --help            Show help for this command.
      --unsafe-trace    Equivalent to -vvvv, but also log HTTP requests and responses which may contain plaintext secrets.
  -v, --verbose count   Increase verbosity (-v for warn, -vv for info, -vvv for debug, -vvvv for trace).
