Delete a Kafka ACL. This command only works with centralized ACLs.

Usage:
  confluent iam acl delete [flags]

Examples:
Delete an ACL that granted the specified user access to the "test" topic in the specified cluster.

  $ confluent iam acl delete --kafka-cluster-id <kafka-cluster-id> --allow --principal User:Jane --topic test

Flags:
      --kafka-cluster-id string   REQUIRED: Kafka cluster ID for scope of ACL commands.
      --allow                     ACL permission to allow access.

                                  operations on the topics that start with that prefix, depending on whether
                                  the --prefix option was also passed.
      --prefix                    Set to match all resource names prefixed with this value.
