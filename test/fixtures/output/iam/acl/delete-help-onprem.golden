Usage:
  confluent iam acl delete [flags]

Examples:
Delete an ACL that granted the specified user access to the "test" topic in the specified cluster.

  $ confluent iam acl delete --kafka-cluster <kafka-cluster-id> --allow --principal User:Jane --topic test --operation write --host "*"

Flags:
      --kafka-cluster string      REQUIRED: Kafka cluster ID for scope of ACL commands.
      --principal string          REQUIRED: Principal for this operation with User: or Group: prefix.
      --operation string          REQUIRED: Set ACL Operation to: (all, alter, alter-configs, cluster-action, create, delete, describe, describe-configs, idempotent-write, read, write).
      --host string               REQUIRED: Set host for access. Only IP addresses are supported. (default "*")

      --deny                      ACL permission to restrict access to resource.
      --cluster-scope             Set the cluster resource. With this option the ACL grants

      --transactional-id string   Set the TransactionalID resource.

                                  operations on the topics that start with that prefix, depending on whether
                                  the --prefix option was also passed.
      --prefix                    Set to match all resource names prefixed with this value.
      --force                     Skip the deletion confirmation prompt.
