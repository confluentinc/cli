Confluent Cloud:

Log in to Confluent Cloud using your email and password, or using single sign-on (SSO) credentials.

Email and password login can be accomplished non-interactively using the `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_EMAIL` and `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_PASSWORD` environment variables.

Email and password can also be stored locally for non-interactive re-authentication with the `--save` flag.

SSO login can be accomplished headlessly using the `--no-browser` flag, but non-interactive login is not natively supported. Authentication tokens last 8 hours and are automatically refreshed with CLI client usage. If the client is not used for more than 8 hours, you have to log in again.

Log in to a specific Confluent Cloud organization using the `--organization` flag, or by setting the environment variable `CONFLUENT_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION_ID`.

Confluent Platform:

Log in to Confluent Platform with your username and password, the `--url` flag to identify the location of your Metadata Service (MDS), and the `--certificate-authority-path` flag to identify your self-signed certificate chain.

Login can be accomplished non-interactively using the `CONFLUENT_PLATFORM_USERNAME`, `CONFLUENT_PLATFORM_PASSWORD`, `CONFLUENT_PLATFORM_MDS_URL`, and `CONFLUENT_PLATFORM_CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY_PATH` environment variables.

In a non-interactive login, `CONFLUENT_PLATFORM_MDS_URL` replaces the `--url` flag, and `CONFLUENT_PLATFORM_CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY_PATH` replaces the `--certificate-authority-path` flag.

Even with the environment variables set, you can force an interactive login using the `--prompt` flag.

Usage:
  confluent login [flags]

Examples:
Log in to Confluent Cloud.

  $ confluent login

  $ confluent login --organization 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

Log in to Confluent Platform with a MDS URL.

  $ confluent login --url http://localhost:8090

Log in to Confluent Platform with a MDS URL and Certification Authority certificate.

  $ confluent login --url https://localhost:8090 --certificate-authority-path certs/my-cert.crt

Log in to Confluent Platform with SSO and ignore any saved credentials.

  CONFLUENT_PLATFORM_SSO=true confluent login --url https://localhost:8090 --certificate-authority-path certs/my-cert.crt

Flags:
      --url string                          Metadata Service (MDS) URL, for on-premises deployments.
      --certificate-authority-path string   Self-signed certificate chain in PEM format, for on-premises deployments.
      --no-browser                          Do not open a browser window when authenticating using Single Sign-On (SSO).
      --organization string                 The Confluent Cloud organization to log in to. If empty, log in to the default organization.
      --prompt                              Bypass non-interactive login and prompt for login credentials.
      --save                                Save username and encrypted password (non-SSO credentials) to the configuration file in your $HOME directory, and to macOS keychain if applicable. You will be logged back in when your token expires, after one hour for Confluent Cloud, or after six hours for Confluent Platform.

Global Flags:
  -h, --help            Show help for this command.
      --unsafe-trace    Equivalent to -vvvv, but also log HTTP requests and responses which might contain plaintext secrets.
  -v, --verbose count   Increase verbosity (-v for warn, -vv for info, -vvv for debug, -vvvv for trace).
