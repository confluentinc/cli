[WARN] This command still works to select the connectivity type and set a public or private endpoint for Flink dataplane client.

Suggestions:
    \nAlternatively, you can run "confluent flink endpoint list" and "confluent flink endpoint use" to view and specify an active endpoint for Flink dataplane client, including CCN endpoints.

Using Flink connectivity type "private".
