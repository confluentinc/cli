To update to the new CLI, run `ccloud update --major`. See the migration guide for more details: https://docs.confluent.io/ccloud-cli/current/migrate.html

Error: Unknown API key UNKNOWN

Suggestions:
    Ensure the API key you are trying to store exists and has not been deleted, or create a new API key via `ccloud api-key create`.
