The Confluent Cloud CLI is deprecated and will stop working on May 9, 2022. All `ccloud` features have been moved to the Confluent CLI: https://docs.confluent.io/confluent-cli/current/index.html
To update to the new CLI, run `ccloud update --major`. See the migration guide for more details: https://docs.confluent.io/ccloud-cli/current/migrate.html

In the next major version update, the `--service-account` flag no longer accepts user IDs.

Error: service account "sa-123456" not found

Suggestions:
    List service accounts with `ccloud service-account list`.
