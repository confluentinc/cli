The `ccloud` CLI is scheduled for deprecation. All `ccloud` features have been moved to the `confluent` CLI.
For more details: https://docs.confluent.io/ccloud-cli/current/index.html

In the next major version update, the `--service-account` flag no longer accepts user IDs.

Error: service account "sa-123456" not found

Suggestions:
    List service accounts with `ccloud service-account list`.
