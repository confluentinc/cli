The `ccloud` CLI is scheduled for deprecation. All `ccloud` features have been moved to the `confluent` CLI.

Error: unable to set active API key: Unknown API key UNKNOWN

Suggestions:
    If you did not create this API key with the CLI or created it on another computer, you must first store the API key and secret locally with `ccloud api-key store UNKNOWN <secret>`.
