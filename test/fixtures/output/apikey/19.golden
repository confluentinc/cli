=======
The Confluent Cloud CLI is deprecated and will no longer be supported on May 9, 2022. All `ccloud` features have been moved to the Confluent CLI: https://docs.confluent.io/confluent-cli/current/index.html
To update to the new CLI, run `ccloud update --major`. See the migration guide for more details: https://docs.confluent.io/ccloud-cli/current/migrate.html

Error: unable to set active API key: UIAPIKEY103

Suggestions:
    If you did not create this API key with the CLI or created it on another computer, you must first store the API key and secret locally with `ccloud api-key store UIAPIKEY103 <secret>`.
