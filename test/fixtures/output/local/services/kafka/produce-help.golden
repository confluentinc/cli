Produce data to topics. By default this command produces non-Avro data to the Apache KafkaÂ® cluster on localhost.

Usage:
  confluent local services kafka produce <topic> [flags]

Examples:
Produce Avro data to a topic called `mytopic1` on a development Kafka cluster on localhost. Assumes Confluent Schema Registry is listening at `http://localhost:8081`.

  $ confluent local services kafka produce mytopic1 --value-format avro --property value.schema='{"type":"record","name":"myrecord","fields":[{"name":"f1","type":"string"}]}'

Produce non-Avro data to a topic called `mytopic2` on a development Kafka cluster on localhost:

  $ confluent local produce mytopic2

Flags:
      --cloud                            Consume from Confluent Cloud.
      --config string                    Change the Confluent Cloud configuration file. ((default \"^\/.*\/\.confluent\/config$\"))
      --value-format string              Format output data: avro, json, or protobuf.
                                         
      --batch-size int                   Number of messages to send in a single batch if they are not being sent synchronously. (default 200)
      --bootstrap-server string          The server(s) to connect to. The broker list string has the form HOST1:PORT1,HOST2:PORT2.
      --compression-codec string         The compression codec: either "none", "gzip", "snappy", "lz4", or "zstd". If specified without value, then it defaults to "gzip".
      --line-reader string               The class name of the class to use for reading lines from stdin. By default each line is read as a separate message. (default "kafka.tools.ConsoleProducer$LineMessageReader")
      --max-block-ms int                 The max time that the producer will block for during a send request. (default 60000)
      --max-memory-bytes int             The total memory used by the producer to buffer records waiting to be sent to the server. (default 33554432)
      --max-partition-memory-bytes int   The buffer size allocated for a partition. When records are received which are small than this size, the producer will attempt to optimistically group them together until this size is reached. (default 16384)
      --message-send-max-retries int     This property specifies the number of retries before the producer gives up and drops this message. Brokers can fail receiving a message for multiple reasons, and being unavailable transiently is just one of them. (default 3)
      --metadata-expiry-ms int           The amount of time in milliseconds before a forced metadata refresh. This will occur independent of any leadership changes. (default 300000)
      --producer\-property string         A mechanism to pass user-defined properties in the form key=value to the producer.
      --producer.config string           Producer config properties file. Note that [producer\-property] takes precedence over this config.
      --property strings                 A mechanism to pass user-defined properties in the form key=value to the message reader. This allows custom configuration for a user-defined message reader. Default properties include:
                                         	parse.key=true|false
                                         	key.separator=<key.separator>
                                         	ignore.error=true|false
      --request-required-acks string     The required ACKs of the producer requests. (default 1)
      --request-timeout-ms int           The ACK timeout of the producer requests. Value must be positive. (default 1500)
      --retry-backoff-ms int             Before each retry, the producer refreshes the metadata of relevant topics. Since leader election takes a bit of time, this property specifies the amount of time that the producer waits before refreshing the metadata. (default 100)
      --socket-buffer-size int           The size of the TCP RECV size. (default 102400)
      --sync                             If set, message send requests to brokers arrive synchronously.
      --timeout int                      If set and the producer is running in asynchronous mode, this gives the maximum amount of time a message will queue awaiting sufficient batch size. The value is given in ms. (default 1000)

Global Flags:
  -h, --help            Show help for this command.
      --unsafe-trace    Equivalent to -vvvv, but also log HTTP requests and responses which might contain plaintext secrets.
  -v, --verbose count   Increase verbosity (-v for warn, -vv for info, -vvv for debug, -vvvv for trace).
