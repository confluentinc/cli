Error: Kafka cluster "lkc-unknown" not found or access forbidden: resource not found

Suggestions:
    Ensure the cluster ID you entered is valid.
    Ensure the cluster you are specifying belongs to the currently selected environment with `confluent kafka cluster list`, `confluent environment list`, and `confluent environment use`.
    The active Kafka cluster may have been deleted. Set a new active cluster with `confluent kafka cluster use`.
