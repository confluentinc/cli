    Ensure the cluster ID you entered is valid.
    Ensure the cluster you are specifying belongs to the currently selected environment with `confluent kafka cluster list`, `confluent environment list`, and `confluent environment use`.
    Ensure the cluster is not associated with any active Connect clusters.
