The `ccloud` CLI is scheduled for deprecation. All `ccloud` features have been moved to the `confluent` CLI.
For more details: https://docs.confluent.io/ccloud-cli/current/index.html

In the next major version update, `ApiEndpoint` has been renamed to `KAPI` and will only be shown if the `--all` flag is used.
