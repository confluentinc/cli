Brief description:
	Plugins are standalone executable files that allow users to extend the 
	functionality of the confluent CLI. Plugins can be called from the confluent
	CLI as if they were built-in commands.

Making plugins discoverable by the CLI:
	The filename of a plugin makes it discoverable by the confluent CLI and 
	determines its command syntax. The filename must begin with `confluent-`. It 
	must be executable and located in a directory on the user's $PATH. Each
	dash (-) in a plugin filename delimits a subcommand in the callable syntax.
	For example, the plugin file `/User/me/plugins/confluent-demo-env-create` 
	would be executed with the confluent CLI command `confluent demo env create`.
	Additionally, the parent directory must be on the user's $PATH. For example,
	by adding `export PATH=$PATH:/User/me/plugins` to the user's .zshrc file.

Arguments and flags with plugins:
	Arguments and flags can be passed with plugin commands. It is the plugin's
	responsibility to validate and parse them. For example, if you run 
	`confluent demo env create arg0 --flag0 true`, the confluent CLI will first
	look for a plugin with the longest possible name: `confluent-demo-env-create-arg0` 
	in this case. If that is not found, it will look for a plugin with the next longest 
	possible name: `confluent-demo-env-create` in this case. If it finds that, it will invoke
	the confluent-demo-env-create plugin, passing along `arg0 --flag true` for
	the plugin's code to parse.

Naming collisions with existing CLI commands and other plugins:
	Built-in confluent CLI commands take precedence over plugins if they share 
	the same name. For example, there is a built-in `confluent kafka cluster list`
	command. A plugin named `confluent-kafka-cluster-list` on the user's $PATH will 
	therefore not run. The built-in command will be run, along with a warning that the plugin 
	has been ignored.  Partial overlap between a plugin’s name and a built-in command, however, 
	is allowed. For example, a plugin named `confluent-kafka-cluster-rebuild` would be 
	callable with the command `confluent kafka cluster rebuild`, since the name does not 
	exactly match a built-in command. If two or more plugins with the same name are found in the
	user's $PATH, the first one found in the $PATH is given precedence. Any subsequent plugin files 
	with the same name will be ignored.

Usage:
  confluent plugin [command]

Available Commands:
  install     Install official Confluent CLI plugins.
  list        List Confluent CLI plugins in $PATH.
  search      Search for available Confluent CLI plugins.

Global Flags:
  -h, --help            Show help for this command.
      --unsafe-trace    Equivalent to -vvvv, but also log HTTP requests and responses which might contain plaintext secrets.
  -v, --verbose count   Increase verbosity (-v for warn, -vv for info, -vvv for debug, -vvvv for trace).

Use "confluent plugin [command] --help" for more information about a command.
